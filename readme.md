## Credits:

BIGGEST kudos to Devon for coming up with a better way to generate the image

HUGE kudos to r/osuplace for the original code: oralekin & exdeejay

AND to the r/greenlattice team, who I copied directly! Nice work artillect#8709, jcb#1032 & jumpinglizard#4404

This has been a blast, no matter what happens from here.
